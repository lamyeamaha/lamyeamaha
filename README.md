### Hi World ðŸ‘‹, I am Lamyea Maha
I am Lamyea and I love to develop projects as I learn new things. This gives me hands-on experience and allows me to showcase my technical abilities. I have worked on designing and developing websites, however, now I am more interested in exploring AI, ML, and DL and applying them to solve real-life problems.

Skills: Java / Python / C++/ HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building ML projects 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to statistically explore different AI models
